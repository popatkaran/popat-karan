# Personality Analysis

At the time of your birth, Virgo Ascendant (Lagna) was rising with Aries Navamsa and Capricorn Dreskana in the first Pad of Hasta which throws up two divergent qualities of your nature - you will be well versed in holy scriptures having a thorough knowledge of religion; and you wouldn't mind resorting to questionable means to achieve your goals.

Obsessed with the passion to amass wealth, it seems you would go to any length to secure
it. Merciless, energetic and industrious, you may be tempted to twist the truth and give the go-by to fair play and decency to realise your goal. You are a happy-go-lucky chap, eager to enjoy worldly pleasures. Good at heart, you will have many social contacts in which you will always look for the company of the opposite sex.
That is why you shun matrimony for many years, but once you select a partner, you will stick to him/her like a leech. You will, in fact, become a home bird devoted to the family. In this, your spouse plays a vital part, as your partner will be god- fearing, always making it a point to keep you happy. Through your spouse you will also beget very good children, about whom you don't have to have any worry, as they are sure to be well educated and comfortably settled in life.

But it will not be all smooth sailing for you. You will have to brace yourself against hurdles and combat them effectively. This you are surely capable of, provided you display determination and single-minded purpose. But since you have a fickle mind, you are apt to alter your stance time and again. You will have to abandon this trait, by making up your mind on your course of action and then follow it up with vigour.

Better give up your desire for drinks. If you don't it may spoil your good health. During your youth and middle age, your constitution can battle out any adversity, but as you grow old, you may experience the ill-effects of liquor. Not that any major diseases will afflict you, but you will have to be careful about the incidence of headache and back ache, tumour and blood pressure in your old age. Since you are assured of a long life, it would be in your interest to safeguard against possible diseases.

The lucky days for you are Wednesday and Friday whereas Saturdayday is average. The other four days are not too favourable as they will prove expensive. Also, rely on numbers 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7, and avoid 1 and 8. Your lucky colours are white, yellow, emerald and green. Red, blue and black don't suit you.

This month there is much that is encouraging for your health in the combination of stars that faces you. Any predisposition to sudden acute illness, like fever or inflammations, though of short duration, would get significant relief. Such trouble, would in all probability, not bother you at all.
Back trouble would be similarly relieved.
There are grounds, however, to be apprehensive about the possibility of an eye infection.
This could bother you briefly, but even this could be prevented by appropriate precautionary measures like cleanness and use of suitable preventive medication. Overall, a month, that is quite encouraging for your health.

### Finance

The turn of events would not favour your financial advancement this month, is what the augury from the stars has to say. True enough, there are clear indications that speculation would bring serious losses to some of you. Therefore, it would be wise to stay away from gambling of any sort whatever.
There are also indications that any dispute or litigation that you might be involved in would almost certainly be decided against you, resulting in losses of a substantial nature. You must strive, therefore, to see that the decision in any such matter is postponed to a later and more favourable period. Relations with superiors or employees are also likely to nose-dive; prevent such an eventuality, failing which you would have to face big losses.

### Profession

A favourable set of circumstances would provide excellent opportunities to you for career advancement. You would work hard and succeed in realizing your planned objectives. There is every chance that this would create a whole new range of possibilities for you and you would go on to a much better job or a change of operation in your business. All for the better.
You should also look forward to a good quantity of travel which would also prove quite beneficial. The most favourable direction would be east. This period would also be characterized by a boldness of approach in your professional activities. This would make for efficient functioning and greater qualities of leadership.

### Education

This month your educational efforts are unlikely to have smooth sailing, since the configuration of stars facing you is none too favourable. All examination results this month, of most of you would be below expectations, to say the least.
Technical students and students of medicine would have to work much harder than usual, to maintain their ranking. The artistically inclined are also not going to achieve much. Those pursuing crafts and some technical trades would remain largely unaffected, by the adverse spell of circumstances. Candidates sitting for competitive examinations should go in for extra coaching, since this could well decide the outcome of your efforts.

### Travel

Nothing particularly favourable about the augury from the stars, in so far as gains from travels are concerned. This month you would travel alone mostly by road and by rail, with a fair measure of air travel.
There is also the likelihood of a foreign tour. It is quite certain that all these effort would fail to generate the expected profits or bring any pleasure and satisfaction. This is quite a bleak picture but unfortunately true. A good deal of your travel may be unnecessary and something you could do very well without. East is the most favourable direction.

### Family

This month there is practically nothing of a favourable sort in the augury from the stars, in so
far as your family welfare is concerned. There is a distinct possibility that some you would develop serious tensions in your relations with the female members of the family, particularly your wife. Here, you should use your skill and a lot of tact to keep out of trouble as best as you can.
The family atmosphere even otherwise would be none too congenial, with harmony among the members nowhere in sight. Financially also, you all may not do too well. Therefore, you should be careful about your expenses.

### Children

A fairly beneficial month for your children during which some of them would well go on to some outstanding achievement since the stellar influences are quite favourable. The blessings are, however, not totally unmixed, since those inclined to be stubborn may display a lot of confidence in their behaviour. Violence or such like punishments are not the answer. Patience is.
Some of them would display remarkable qualities of leadership and the gifted would find enough scope for them to perform an outstanding feat, whether it be in their studies or some other extra curricular activity.

## Prediction For March 2025

### Health

This month, you have a set of favourable circumstances promoting your good health. Any predisposition to chronic disorders like rheumatism and gout and irregularities of the digestive system like flatulence and excess of wind would get significant relief. This should, however, not be treated as a license to abandon all caution. With normal caution, there would be masked relief.
There are grounds to be slightly apprehensive about the state of your dental health. Take care of your teeth and you can ensure that nothing untoward happens. In fact, you have a
beneficial month on your hands, during which you will not have to face any serious health hazard.

### Finance

This month the configuration of stars facing you does not augur well for your financial prospects. To begin with, there is a distinct possibility of your relations with your superiors taking a nose-dive. So much so that serious losses would become very probable. This, you must prevent by some foresight and advance action.
Speculation would also almost certainly result in serious losses to some of you, therefore, you should stay away from gambling at all sorts. There is also the danger that some of you would be inclined towards concentrating unduly on generating unaccounted money. Such pursuits would not be in your best interests and should best be avoided.

An excellent month to reap a rich harvest of dividends from travel since the stars are in an
obliging mood. Writers, poets and others of their ilk would find new exciting opportunities for travel that would be an inspiration.
You should tend to travel alone mostly by rail and by road with a fair measure of air travel as well. A foreign trip is also very much on the cards.
